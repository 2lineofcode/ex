### Rules for Developer:

1. If you wanna write new function / utils / etc. don't forget to create unit testing for that scope.

2. make sure structure folder `root & test` must be same.

3. make sure all test passed!

4. Use annotate `@visibleForTesting` as a sign that the function has been tested. 
   so that it is more visible than otherwise necessary, to make code readable. ref : https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/meta/visibleForTesting-constant.html

5. [optional] create sample documentation for every function you write.
